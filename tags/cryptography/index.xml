This is part three of the series on anomalous curves. Go here for part one and here for part two.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll prove the two missing results from the last post:
 Theorem (VII.2.2 in Silverman): There is a group structure on $p\Z_p$ (that we denote $\hat{E}(p\Z_p)$) such that the map $$ E_1(\Q_p) \to \hat{E}(p\Z_p): [x:y:1] \mapsto -\frac x y $$ is a group isomorphism, that also induces isomorphisms $E_n(\Q_p)\to \hat{E}(p^n\Z_p)$.</description>

This is part two of the series on anomalous curves. Go here for part one.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll give a sketch of the construction of Smart&amp;rsquo;s attack. This attack combines two elliptic curve tools:
 The reduction map of an elliptic curve over a local field. The formal group of an elliptic curve.  I will focus on the first one, and leave the details of the second for another post.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Curves Part 1: Don&#39;t be clever with your elliptic curve order</title>

Have you ever been confused by the numbers $p,q,r$ in a paper dealing with elliptic curves? Some paper use $q$ for the order of the elliptic curve over a field of order $p$. Conveniently, other papers use the exact opposite notation, while some get original and use $r$ for the field size, or the order of a subgroup of the curve, or something else&amp;hellip;
What if I told you there are curves where $p=q=r$?</description>

      <title>Membership proofs from polynomial commitments</title>

Recently, Dan Boneh, Ben Fisch, Ariel Gabizon, and Zac Williamson (BFGW) published a writeup showing how to create range proofs from polynomial commitments. As a mental exercise, I wanted to see how to use polynomial commitments to create membership proofs instead. Membership proofs can be seen as a generalization of range proofs, if certain homomorphic properties hold (that&amp;rsquo;s something I learned first from this article). For example for Pedersen commitments, we have:</description>
