      <title>Anomalous curves: don&#39;t try to be clever with your elliptic curve order</title>

Have you ever been confused by the numbers $p,q,r$ in a paper dealing with elliptic curves? Some paper use $q$ for the order of the elliptic curve over a field of order $p$. Conveniently, other papers use the exact opposite notation, while some get original and use $r$ for the field size, or the order of a subgroup of the curve, or something else&amp;hellip;
What if I told you there are curves where $p=q=r$?</description>

Recently, Dan Boneh, Ben Fisch, Ariel Gabizon, and Zac Williamson (BFGW) published a writeup showing how to create range proofs from polynomial commitments. As a mental exercise, I wanted to see how to use polynomial commitments to create membership proofs instead. Membership proofs can be seen as a generalization of range proofs, if certain homomorphic properties hold (that&amp;rsquo;s something I learned first from this article). For example for Pedersen commitments, we have:</description>

      <title>Understanding Verifiable Delay Functions (with a Rust implementation)</title>

      <description>I have been reading about Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) recently and wanted to write a short post explaining what they are and what they can be used for. This post relies mainly on the papers: Efficient verifiable delay functions, Wesolowski and A Survey of Two Verifiable Delay Functions, Boneh et al. I also recommend this podcast with Joseph Bonneau.
Definition A VDF is a function $f_T: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ that takes a long time to compute but is fast to verify.</description>
