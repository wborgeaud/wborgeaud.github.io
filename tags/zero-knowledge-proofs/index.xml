      <description>Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) is a powerful arithmetization that can be extended to Randomized Air with Preprocessing (RAP), which includes popular systems like PLONK. See this great note by Ariel Gabizon for descriptions of these arithmetizations.
Another popular arithmetization is given by R1CS. Two categories of proving systems based on R1CS are those using multivariate techniques (e.g. Spartan) and those using univariate techniques (e.g. Marlin).
To the best of my knowledge, every current AIR-based proving system uses univariate techniques.</description>

      <description>$$ \def\com{\mathbf{com}} $$
Recently, Dan Boneh, Ben Fisch, Ariel Gabizon, and Zac Williamson (BFGW) published a writeup showing how to create range proofs from polynomial commitments. As a mental exercise, I wanted to see how to use polynomial commitments to create membership proofs instead. Membership proofs can be seen as a generalization of range proofs, if certain homomorphic properties hold (that&amp;rsquo;s something I learned first from this article). For example for Pedersen commitments, we have:</description>
